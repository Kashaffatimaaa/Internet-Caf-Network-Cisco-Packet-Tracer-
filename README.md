# Internet-Cafe-Network-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-
📌 Introduction

This project involves the design and configuration of a comprehensive network infrastructure for an Internet Café using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was built to ensure efficient communication, secure access, and resource optimization across multiple departments, including admin, customer stations, gaming zones, technical support, and servers.

The system integrates routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, and security configurations to support both customer-facing services and administrative operations, ensuring smooth, secure, and reliable connectivity.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a robust and efficient network infrastructure tailored to the needs of an Internet Café by:

Creating segmented VLANs for traffic management and performance.

Configuring routers for inter-VLAN communication.

Implementing DHCP for automatic IP allocation.

Enforcing password security for controlled access.

Hosting a web server for services like customer account management and online reservations.

🖥️ System Description

The Internet Café network is divided into the following segments:

Admin Office – Monitors usage, manages accounts, and ensures security through a dedicated VLAN.

Customer Stations – Standard PCs for browsing, study, or casual use.

Gaming Zone – High-performance PCs on a VLAN optimized for low latency.

Technical Support Dept. – Manages troubleshooting, device maintenance, and updates.

Printer & File Sharing Area – Shared printers and storage with VLAN isolation.

Wi-Fi Zone – Wireless access for laptops/smartphones with secure VLAN.

Server Room – Hosts the web server and payment systems with redundancy for reliability.

🖧 Network Topology

Key components in the network include:

Routers – Enable inter-VLAN communication and internet access.

Switches – Connect devices within VLANs.

DHCP Server – Automates IP address assignment.

Web Server – Supports portals, billing, and account management.

PCs/Devices – Represent customer systems, gaming PCs, and admin devices.

⚙️ Configuration Details

Serial Router Configuration – Three routers (Admin, Server Room, Wi-Fi Zone) interconnected for communication.

VLAN Implementation – VLANs for Admin, Customers, Gaming, Printers, Wi-Fi, and Servers.

Password Protection – Secured access for Admin, Customer Stations, and Gaming Zone.

DHCP Deployment – DHCP servers in Admin, Gaming, Wi-Fi, and Printer VLANs for automatic IP distribution.
